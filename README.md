Analysis of the Correctional Institutions of Ontario

https://data.ontario.ca/en/dataset/ontario-s-correctional-institutions-locations

This is an in depth analysis of the Correctional Institutions of Ontario.

The 4 hypotheses we tested were:
1. That the majority of Provincial Correctional Institutions in Ontario would be open due to a growing population in the province.
2. That the most sparcely populated regions of the province would have the greatest amount institutions due to a comparative lack of inmates coming into contact with non-inmates.
3. That jails would not make up the majority of facilities in the province due to a relative lack of overall crime committed that would warrant jail time in comparison to other forms of law breaking.
4. That the majority of facilities in the province would be dominated by men as we theorized that men would be the ones most likely to get into confrontations with the law due to the majority of prisons in Canada being composed of male inmates.

The first 3 of our hypotheses were proven correct but the result of the 4th was quite contrary to our expectations. We did not take into account the idea that there could be mixed Gender facilities for both Women and Men, those of which take up 20 out 35 of the total number correctional institutions in the province. Nonetheless, we learned quite a bit.
